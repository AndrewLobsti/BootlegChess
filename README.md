 this is a chess game, with everything already in except castling and en passant. The final intention is to use an evolutionary 
 method to make it so the moves of the AI will improve based on past games. Currently, it saves the moves of the winning team to a 
 file. The intention is to leave it running for a while, and then make a function to analyze a matrix made of the saved move 
 lists, and then see what moves were the most common in winning games, and to get their index on the matrix so as to make an  
 average of where they tend to be played. Then feed a list of those common moves and when to play them to the AI, to hopefully 
 improve it.
