This is a chess engine, all legal moves are possible, inlcuding castling and en passant. The function that is the brains behind the computer player is a bruteforce algorithm. It checks every possible move it can make, and then recurses to see the enemy responses to that move, and on and on it goes depending on the size of an integer passed down into it, tough 5 is probably the upper boundary before it becomes highly impratical, since the time it takes to execute the function is multiplied by 40 every time the integer passed down to it grows from an odd number into an even number, and roughly triples when it goes from even to odd. At 4 it takes some 40 seconds and at 5 some 130, after that theoretically it would takes 130 * 40 seconds, which would be roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes between each move.
