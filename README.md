This is a chess engine, all legal moves are possible, inlcuding castling and en passant. The computer player  is controlled by a bruteforce algorithm. It checks every possible move it can make, and then recurses to see the enemy responses to that move, and on and on it goes depending on the size of an integer passed down into it. It is quite slow tough, ideal number of iterations probably 3.
