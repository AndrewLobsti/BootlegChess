This is a chess engine, all legal moves are possible, inlcuding castling and en passant. The function that is the brains behind the computer player is a bruteforce algorithm. It checks every possible move it can make, and then recurses to see the enemy responses to that move, and on and on it goes depending on the size of an integer passed down into it, tough 5 is probably the upper boundary before it becomes highly impratical, thanks to the search size.
